Smart Cooling System 
This project is an embedded system implementation of a Smart Cooling System for STM32F103

Features:
- Reads temperature from a LM35 sensor
- Controls a cooling fan based on setpoint temperature
- use  Strategy Pattern (Function Pointers for Hardware Abstraction) and  Layered Architecture (Separation of Hardware & Software) in 
  embedded software developement

TODO List:
- Automated CI/CD Pipeline: Set up **GitHub Actions** for **automated testing** before deployment.
- Remote Monitoring:  Enable connectivity for IoT-based monitoring.
